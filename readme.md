# BatteryStatus 
_A small project for speeding up your windows battery-report generation._

This application generates the standard Windows 10 batter-report with the `powercfg /batteryreport` command and opens the result in your web browser. 

If you want to build the project yourself you can install the pip dependencies from the requirements.txt.
